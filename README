B-tree-Library
==============

  A B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, 
  sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

  A B-tree of order m is a tree which satisfies the following properties:
    * Every node has at most m children.
    * Every non-leaf node (except root) has at least ⌈m⁄2⌉ children.
    * The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.
    * A non-leaf node with k children contains k−1 keys.
    * All leaves appear in the same level, and carry information.


  Features :
    * Generic b-tree
    * Construction of tree for specified order.
    * Insertion of elements
        * Bulk Loading : reverse filling
        * Inserting a single element
    * Bidirectional Iterator
    * Displaying all the elements
        * Like a tree
        * Inorder display
    * Search
    * Sorting based on predicate
